# News-Virality
This repository contains:
1. Code to crawl IndiaTimes website for news articles (News Crawler.py).
2. Code to predict whether a news article will get viral or not (News_Virality.ipynb).

I have set the criteria for a news to be viral to 1500 shares.

Note: The News_Virality.ipynb file requires tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0.
